## How to Run

‚úÖ This script requires Administrator privileges. If not elevated, it will not run and display a clear error.

### Option 1: Run via PowerShell (Admin)

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Execute the script:

    .\windows_audit.ps1

‚ùó If you see a "running scripts is disabled" error, use the bypass method below.

---

### Option 2: Bypass Execution Policy (One-Time Use)

If your system blocks scripts by default, run this instead from PowerShell (Admin):

    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\windows_audit.ps1"

This will temporarily override restrictions and run the script normally.
